		<p> The tags, h# and /h# gives header sections for one by one and the fonts get smaller each time there's more going down. 
As h1 gives a big header, h2 is a slightly smaller than the first, and the following headings appear smaller than the last, then p equals paragraph. </p>
		<p> I'm in Web Development class because I was placed here by one of the guidiance counselers and I added it to my application because I was interested in this along with many programs.
I don't know much about computers and dealing with tech things are not my expertise, so I want to learn more about softwares, editing, and making things online, 
so that it will probably be important to know for the future in career choices and life. <p>
