		<h2> Self-Reflection- Naviance Survey </h2>

      <div class="column">
	<p> From my results taking the Naviance survey, it primarily chose careers in the art department. I still don't know what I'd see myself doing in the future but it could be something involved with designing things. The jobs offered were software designers, web development, writer, poet, and more.    </p>
      </div>
 <div class="column">
   <p> Higher education schools I might look into more will be 4-year colleges, possibly CUNY schools. I also have little knowledge of this topic but maybe Hunter College or other universities with high graduation rates are good for me as well. Somewhere nearby my house or at least within the NYC boroughs are prefferable locations for college I'd like to be in.  </p>
 </div>
    <div class="column">
   <p> More career options that came up from the survey were Health Information Technology or anything that involves computers. Jobs in the medical field also spark some interest in me, so I'll look into schools with those specific majors. </p>
