		<p style="color:Gold"> <b> Megamind, a movie directed by Tom McGrath, is one of my favorite movies because of its interesting characters, plot, and good animation. It's a fun comedy to watch since it can be goofy at times then switch to serious whenever the story progresses. I've haven't seen a cool storyline like this a lot, which is how the bad guy actually becomes the hero at the end of the movie. The main character, called Megamind, is a big, blue headed villain that came from outer space, along with his fish-head hunchman, Minion, try to conquer the ciy by fighting against his long-time nemesis, Metro-Man, is hero admired by all the people of Metro City. After years of bickering back and forth, Metro-Man is tired of it all since he always wins against Megamind and its the same thing over again to him. So, he decides to fake his death in front of Megamind and he won't have to deal being everyone's hero.  <b> </p>
    <p style="color:Gold"><b> Megamind has finally taken control of the city, feeling accomplished, but not long after, he feels empty and bored without a hero he can go up against.
      Megamind decides to train someone to be the next superhero to entertain his lonliness, but things take a turn for the worst when his apprentice,Titan ,does the opposite of what a hero does. The story continues with action, drama, some romance for Megamind, montages, and comedic scenes that follow afterwards. He creates a strong villain instead, so he had to stop him,being viewed as the good guy to the whole city. The color scheme I chose represents the movie becuase the general theme of Megamind is blue, since he is himself is blue and the yellow color makes a good contrast, which adds emphasis and pops out more.  </b></p>
