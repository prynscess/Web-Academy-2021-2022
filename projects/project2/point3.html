  <h2>Keeping your emotions and thoughts in check is a key step to having patience.</h2>
  </div>
  <p>For one, you will have to build it up over time, so a general foundation of self-control, mindfulness and gratitude is something that should be developed through your own experiences.</p>
  <p>When you feel frustrated about a situation that may seem out of your grasp, you should make the most of it and look at it in a different angle that can provide a positive outcome. For example, if you're waiting on someone who's late to the initial meetup time, take the opportunity to read a book, reframing the circumstantces to your advantage.     </p>
        <div id="cookie">
        <p> Be mindful of your actions, having to wait for the right moments of what's to be desired. </p>
