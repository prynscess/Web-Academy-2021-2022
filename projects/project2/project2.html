       <h1>✨The Value of Patience
🕐</h1>
      </div>
		
      <div class="main">
  
  <p> Patience is a value I try to follow by everyday and is something I find difficult to uphold but helps me become a better person in the process. </p>
  <p> I think it's important to know how to wait for things, so I believe patience is associated on our  behavior while taking our time for something to happen. Having impatience with yourself can redirect towards others, which can create conflicts amongst your relationships and possible mental health problems if it becomes a frequent habit.     </p>
         <div id="cookie">
  <p> Taking things slow, handling situations more calmly and confidently, as well as the ability to think more positively are ways that improved my daily life. With this value, stress feels slightly less of a issue for me since I allow myself to create time for my struggles, learning more about myself and how to deal with them in an peaceful manner. I was able to look at the brighter side and helped me enjoy  moments my friends and family. I usually tend to become irritated if things get start getting difficult to handle, so I value this idea because it pushes me to make more mindful decisions and builds up the perserverance needed to reach my goals.
